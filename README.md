# sql-challenge

Background
It’s been two weeks since you were hired as a new data engineer at Pewlett Hackard (a fictional company). Your first major task is to do a research project about people whom the company employed during the 1980s and 1990s. All that remains of the employee database from that period are six CSV files.

For this project, you’ll design the tables to hold the data from the CSV files, import the CSV files into a SQL database, and then answer questions about the data. That is, you’ll perform data modeling, data engineering, and data analysis, respectively.


--Data Modeling
Inspect the CSV files, and then sketch an Entity Relationship Diagram of the tables

--Data Engineering
Use the provided information to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files
-Will be found under the sql file named "Data Engineering"


--Data Analysis
Will be found under the sql file named "Data Analysis"
1. Analysis of the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.

2. Analysis of the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Analysis of the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.

4. Analysis of the department number for each employee along with that employee’s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
